# Exchangis1.0 User Manual

## 一、Product introduction 

&emsp;&emsp; This article is a quick entry document of Exchangis 1.0, covering the basic usage process of Exchangis 1.0. Exchangis a lightweight data exchange service platform, which supports data synchronization between different types of data sources. The platform data exchange process is split, and the concepts of data source, data exchange task and task scheduling are abstracted, so as to achieve the purpose of visual management of data synchronization process. In the actual data transmission process, the characteristics of multiple transmission components can be integrated to achieve horizontal expansion of functions. 

## 二、Login Exchangis1.0

&emsp;&emsp; Exchangis1.0 is currently a part of DSS**data exchange component**, and it can be accessed in the component list by logging in to DSS. Therefore, before using Exchangis 1.0, please make basic deployment of DSS, Exchange IS 1.0, Linkis and other related components to ensure that the components' functions are available. This article will not go into details. See for details:[exchangis_deploy_en](https://github.com/WeDataSphere/Exchangis/blob/dev-1.0.0-rc/docs/en_US/ch1/exchangis_deploy_en.md)和[exchangis-appconn_deploy_en](https://github.com/WeDataSphere/Exchangis/blob/dev-1.0.0-rc/docs/en_US/ch1/exchangis_appconn_deploy_en.md)

### 1、Login DSS

&emsp;&emsp; By default, the system uses Linux deployment users of Linkis to log in to DSS. If users of hadoop deploy Linkis and DSS, they can log in directly through the account password: hadoop/hadoop. First log in to the webpage according to the front-end deployment address of DSS, and then enter the account password: hadoop/hadoop to enter DSS. 

### 2、Enter Exchangis

&emsp;&emsp; Exchangis is accessed through DSS. Click on the word: **Home ->DSS Application Components-> Data Exchange-> Enter Exchange**.

## 三、Datasource management

&emsp;&emsp;This module can configure and manage data sources. As the initial step of data synchronization, Exchangis1.0 currently supports direct data import between mysql and hive. 
The main functions of data source are as follows ：

1.	 Create, edit and delete data sources;
2.	 Search data sources by type and name, and support quick positioning of data sources;
3.	 Data source connection test operation;
4.	 Release and record of historical data source version.

### 2、Datasource function

&emsp;&emsp; The data source management module provides the function of **publishing** the version of the configured data source. Only the published data source can be used when configuring derivative tasks, otherwise, it will prompt that it is unavailable. As long as the data source is edited again, it will be regarded as a new version, and the latest version is in the first row. You can **view** the configuration of all historical data source versions in the version list, and you can refer to it whenever you need to roll back.

## 四、Project management

### 1、Project list

&emsp;&emsp; This module can create projects. In actual derivative tasks, there can be multiple derivative tasks under a project, and different projects do not affect each other. For ordinary users, they can only operate their own created projects. On the homepage of project management, you can manage projects, including **create**, **modify** and **delete** and **query and search**. Modification and deletion can only be performed on projects created in Exchangis.

![item_list](../../../images/zh_CN/ch1/item_list.png)

 </div>


### 2、Task list

&emsp;&emsp; You can manage the created Job data synchronization tasks in the task list, similar to projects, including **Create**, **Modify**, **Delete** and **Search**. 

![job_task_list](../../../images/zh_CN/ch1/job_task_list.png)
<div align="center">
Pic3-2 Task list
 </div>

&emsp;&emsp; In addition, the **task supports copying**, which can increase the required tasks. The copied task contains all the information of its original task configuration. Click **Create Task** to select the task type and execution engine. **Currently, only offline tasks and SQOOP execution engine** are supported, and streaming tasks and DataX engines will be supported in the future.

### 3、Synchronize data task configuration and execution 

&emsp;&emsp; Data synchronization task configuration and execution is the core function of Exchangis1.0. The basic configuration data synchronization process is: **Add subtasks-> Select source data source database table and destination data source database table (add data source in data source management module for selection)-> Field mapping (default)-> Process control (default)-> Configuration (default)-> Execute**. 

The main functions of task execution include: 
1.	 Add, copy and delete subtask cards ；
2.	 Realize the import and export of data between two different types of data sources ；
3.	 Selection of library tables for source and destination data sources ；
4.	 Datasource field mapping ；
5.	 Maximum job concurrency and maximum job memory configuration ；
6.	 Data synchronization task execution status view ；
7.	 Log view of each main task and each subtask ；
8.	 Task execution history status view ；
9.	 Execute the task kill operation. 

### 4、Selecting and configuring data sources 

&emsp;&emsp;Click **Add Sub-task** to start creating a data synchronization task. For the newly created data synchronization sub-task, you must first select the data source library table. The data source must be configured in advance in the **data source management module** before it will appear in the task configuration. Select the data source to support search, and the search method is to search the library first, and then search the table.

![add_subtask](../../../images/zh_CN/ch1/add_subtask.png)
<div align="center">
Pic3-4 Add sub-task
 </div>

&emsp;&emsp;When MySQL is the destination data source, it supports **insert** and **update** two writing methods; When it is the source data source, it supports **WHERE conditional statement query**.

&emsp;&emsp; When Hive is the destination data source, partition information configuration is supported, and the writing methods are **append data** and **overwrite**; When the source data source is **partition information configuration is supported**.

### 5、Datasource field mapping 

&emsp;&emsp; When the data source library table information is configured, Exchangis1.0 will automatically generate automatic field mapping between the original data source and the destination data source in the **field mapping** line, and you can choose the field you want to map; When HIVE is the destination data source, its mapping field cannot be modified, which should be noted. 

### 6、Process control

&emsp;&emsp; Task execution provides the configuration of the maximum parallel number of tasks and the maximum memory configuration of jobs, which can be changed according to actual needs. 

### 7、Job execution 

&emsp;&emsp;Exchangis1.0  support the simultaneous execution of multiple subtasks. After the task configuration is completed, click Execute to start the data synchronization task, and the workbench will pop up at the bottom of the interface. The workbench mainly contains three functions: **running status, real-time log and execution history** .
&emsp;&emsp; **Running Status** :You can view the overall progress of the current data synchronization task, including the number of successes and failures of the task, and click on the name of the task to display the information of various running indicators of each task. 

&emsp;&emsp; **Real-time log** :The main display contents include two categories. One is the log of the whole derivative job, which can output the status log of each task, such as whether the task is scheduled or not, and whether it is running moderately; The second is the log of each task, and the output is the corresponding derivative log. In the real-time log, the log can be filtered according to keywords and ignored words, and the function of obtaining the last N lines of logs is provided separately; You can also screen and display different types of logs of Error, Warning and Info, just click the corresponding button. 

&emsp;&emsp; **Execution History** :It can display the historical execution information of this derivative task and provide a preliminary overview of the historical execution process. If you want to further view the detailed historical information, click on the task name to jump to the synchronous history interface for viewing. 

&emsp;&emsp; Data synchronization task execution needs to specify the execution user, which is the login user by default. The specific situation needs to be adjusted according to the configuration of the actual data source. 


## 五、Synchronous history 

&emsp;&emsp; This module can view all data synchronization tasks performed historically, and each user can only view the tasks created by himself. Different users are isolated from each other. 

 The main functions are as follows: 
1.	 Find the required historical task information according to the query conditions ；
2.	 For non-terminal tasks, the function of terminating tasks is provided, which can kill non-terminal tasks ；
3.	 Check the running status and real-time day of each task ；
4.	 View more detailed configuration information and update time of each synchronization task .

## 六、Exchangis Appconn uses

&emsp;&emsp; At present, Exchangis1.0 supports docking with DSS in the form of Appconn, **on the DSS side**, data exchange sqoop workflow node can be created in the mode of workflow arrangement through **application development-> project list ** of DSS, where data synchronization tasks can be configured and executed. Exchangis projects and data exchange tasks created in DSS will be created in Exchangis at the same time.

Exchangis Appconn  mainly supports the following functions ：

1. **Project operation ** is the creation, deletion and modification of DSS projects, which will synchronously affect the projects on Exchangis；

2. **Basic operation of workflow node **is the task of creating, deleting and modifying sqoop workflow nodes in DSS choreographer, which will be synchronized to Exchangis.

   It is the task of creating, deleting and modifying sqoop workflow nodes in DSS choreographer, which will be synchronized to Exchangis；

3. **Workflow derivative operation ** support sqoop workflow node configuration to perform data synchronization tasks；

4. **Workflow publishing operation ** support sqoop workflow nodes to publish to WTSS for task scheduling. 

### 1、Project operation 

&emsp;&emsp; This module can create, modify and delete DSS projects, and the operations on the DSS side will be synchronized to the Exchange is side. Here, take the project created in DSS as an example, and the process of operation in Exchange is as follows: **Click Create Project-> Fill in project information-> Click Confirm-> Enter Exchange is side-> Click Project Management**, and you can view the synchronously created projects, as shown in the following figure:

![appconn_pro_create](../../../images/zh_CN/ch1/appconn_pro_create.png)
