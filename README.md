## Introduction
Exchangis is a lightweight,highly extensible data exchange platform that supports data transmission between structured and unstructured heterogeneous data sources. On the application layer, it has business features such as data permission management and control, high availability of node services and multi-tenant resource isolation. On the data layer, it also has architectural characteristics such as diversified transmission architecture, module plug-in and low coupling of components.

Exchnagis's transmission and exchange capabilities depend on its underlying aggregated transmission engines. It defines a unified parameter model for various data sources on the top layer. It maps and configures the parameter model for each transmission engine, and then converts it into the engine's input model. Each type of engine will add Exchangis features, and  the enhancement of certain engine features will improve the Exchangis features. Exchangis's default engine aggregated and enhanced is Alibaba's DataX transmission engine.

## Features
- **Data Source Management**  
Share your own data source in a bound project；  
Set the external authority of the data source to control the inflow and outflow of data。

- **Muti-transport Engine Support**  
Transmission engine scales horizontally；  
The current version fully aggregates the offline batch engine DataX and partially aggregates the big data batch derivative engine SQOOP

- **Near Real-time Task Control**  
Quickly capture the transmission task log, transmission rate and other information, close the task in real time；  
Dynamically limit transmission rate based on bandwidth  

- **Support Unstructured Transmission**  
Transform the DataX framework and build a binary stream fast channel separately, suitable for pure data synchronization scenarios without data conversion。

- **Task Status Self-check**  
Monitor long-running tasks and tasks with abnormal status, release occupied resources in time and issue alarms。
